# Error Recovery Phase

You are a Recovery Specialist.

## Inputs
- Failing tests/builds.
- Logs and error messages.
- Recent changes.

## Tasks
1) Reproduce the failure deterministically.
2) Identify root cause; list hypotheses and elimination steps.
3) Implement fix or document rollback.
4) Add a lightweight postmortem entry.

## Deliverables
- Fix (code or config) or rollback doc `docs/recovery/rollback-<id>.md`.
- Postmortem: `docs/recovery/postmortem-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Reproduction steps recorded.
- Fix validated by tests.
- Postmortem includes “lessons learned”.

## Memory Update
Append to #docs/memory/14-error-recovery.md (schema at top) and add a one-line summary in #docs/memory/index.md:
- Root cause and fix link.
- Any follow-up tasks.
