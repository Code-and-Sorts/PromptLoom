# Demo — Project Memory Index

> Structured memory to minimize hallucinations and improve retrieval.
> Keep entries concise and link to source-of-truth docs (requirements, ADRs, tests).

## How to use
- When working in a phase, read the **matching per-phase memory file** below.
- Append new entries to that file using the schema shown in each file header.
- Keep this index lean; add a one-line summary under "Recent Activity" and link to the per-phase entry.

## Per-Phase Files
- [01 Requirements](01-requirements.md)
- [02 User Stories](02-user-stories.md)
